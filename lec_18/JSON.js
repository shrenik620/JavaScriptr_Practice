// JSON==== JS object notation 
// JSON is a format for data interchange, not a JavaScript object itself.
// It is often used to send data between a server and a web application.
// JSON is a string representation of an object, while JavaScript objects are actual objects in memory.
// JSON is a text format that is completely language independent but uses conventions that are familiar to programmers of the C family of languages, which includes C, C++, C#, Java, JavaScript, Perl, Python, and many others.
